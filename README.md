Generation and Transmission Expansion Planning with Full-year Hourly Power Balance
Variable renewables energy are leading the energy
transition and power system flexibility has become a global
priority. Incorporating short-term assessment into long-term 
planning is essential to capture the operational characteristics of 
generation and address flexibility issues. This paper presents a 
novel model for generation and transmission expansion planning 
with economic dispatch. In the generation expansion planning, the 
capacity expansion is optimized. In the economic dispatch problem, 
power plant operation, hydropower generation, and line 
transmission power flow are optimized. The model is a mixed-
integer linear programming problem solved in MATLAB using 
Gurobi toolbox. A model is proposed to optimize the reservoir of 
hydropower systems and run-of-river. A case study for supplying 
Brazilian demand in 2050 is presented. A scenario with greenhouse
gas emission costs and no deficit is proposed. This study has shown 
that the current penalty cost for loss of load is not sufficient to 
avoid a deficit. It is possible to supply 2050 demand, without large 
reservoirs or deficits, with a 5.5% curtailment, using 13% of total 
storage capacity, however; peaking power plants are required.
